  If you use any of my plugins, please star them on github. It's a great way
  of getting feedback and gives me the kick to put more time into their
  development.

  If you encounter any bugs or have feature requests, just open an issue
  report on Github.

  Thank you for flying mhi^ airlines. Get the Vim on!

INTRO                                                   *toplevel-section-intro*

vim-toplevel helps changing to the root directory of a version control system.

Supported VCS:~
>
    - git
    - hg
    - bzr

If you want support for another VCS, please open an issue report on Github (or
send a pull request). Thanks!

COMMANDS                                             *toplevel-section-commands*

There are really just two commands:
>
    :Cd        change directory for the current window
    :Cd!       change directory for all windows
<
This command uses the builtin function |finddir()| to get the VCS root repository
and change to it. It starts searching from the directory of the current
buffer.
>
    :Root      change directory for the current window
    :Root!     change directory for all windows
>
This command uses the builtin function |system()| to start external programs
(e.g. "git" or "hg") to get the VCS root directory and change to it.

==============================================================================
OPTIONS                                               *toplevel-section-options*

Put these variables into your vimrc:
>
    let g:toplevel_vcs_list = ['git', 'hg']
<
Tell vim-toplevel what VCS to look for and in what order.

Possible values are: ['git', 'hg', 'bzr']
>
    let g:toplevel_enable_vimshell = 0

If you're on Windows and have vim-misc/vim-shell installed, enabling this will
avoid the annoying flickering of the cmd.exe popping up for the fraction of a
second. Only makes a difference for :Root, not for :Cd.
